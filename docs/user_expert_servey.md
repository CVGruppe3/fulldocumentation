# Survey

As an integral part of our Project we did a small survey with one of the actors in our business ecosystem.
In the following Chapter we show some very interesting answers to a individualized questionaire we designed for our Project.

## The Expert Interview

In the Beginning of our Project we reached out to several important actors for our use case. 
One of these actors are the Production Companies of Cashier Systems in the German market.

Through an interview with the managing director of PROCOM iPOS Systems GmbH we could draw decisive conclusions on our project. 

The original completed questionnaire can be looked up below.
